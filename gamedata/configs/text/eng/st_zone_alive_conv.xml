</string>
<string id="st_conv_combat_legendary_kill_humor_4_3">
    <text>Solo $what kill. Retirement fund secured. Or funeral fund. Probably funeral.</text>

     ===================================================================== -->

<!-- Stage 0: Incident (Relief) -->
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_1">
    <text>Emission caught me in $where. Made it to shelter with 10 seconds left.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_2">
    <text>Blowout hit while I was in the open. Barely found cover in time.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_3">
    <text>Survived my $count emission. Still can't believe it.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_4">
    <text>Was crossing $where when emission warning hit. Closest call of my life.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_5">
    <text>Found a basement with 5 seconds to spare. Heart's still pounding.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_6">
    <text>Emission caught me mid-looting. Ditched the gear and ran. Still alive.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_7">
    <text>Blowout in $where. Shelter was further than I thought. Made it anyway.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_8">
    <text>Dove into a basement covered in rats during emission. Better than dead.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_9">
    <text>Warning came late. Had to sprint through anomaly field to reach shelter.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_relief_0_10">
    <text>Survived emission outside. Don't ask how. I don't know either.</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 1: Rookie Question (Curiosity) -->
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_1">
    <text>How do you stay calm? I would've panicked.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_2">
    <text>What goes through your head when the warning hits?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_3">
    <text>10 seconds?! How is that even possible?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_4">
    <text>Do you ever get used to emissions?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_5">
    <text>What if there's no shelter nearby?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_6">
    <text>How many emissions have you survived?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_7">
    <text>Were you scared?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_8">
    <text>I heard emissions fry your brain. Is that true?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_9">
    <text>What's the trick to surviving blowouts?</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_curious_1_10">
    <text>Better to run or hide?</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 2: Veteran Wisdom -->
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_1">
    <text>Panic is how you die. I've been through $count emissions. You learn to run straight, not fast.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_2">
    <text>Scared? Every time. Fear keeps you sharp. Panic kills.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_3">
    <text>Never get used to it. You just get better at not dying.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_4">
    <text>No shelter? Find one. Make one. Or pray. Usually pray.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_5">
    <text>Trick is simple: Always know where the nearest shelter is. Always.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_6">
    <text>10 seconds is a lifetime if you don't waste it panicking.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_7">
    <text>Brain damage? Probably. But I'm alive to worry about it later.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_8">
    <text>Run toward shelter, not away from emission. Zone doesn't care about your fear.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_9">
    <text>What goes through my head? Shelter location, distance, time. Math saves lives.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_wisdom_2_10">
    <text>I count emissions like medals. Each one means I'm still here.</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 3: Squad Experience (Mentorship) -->
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_1">
    <text>Lost my whole squad to a blowout because they scattered. Stay together.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_2">
    <text>Seen rookies freeze during warnings. Don't be that rookie.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_3">
    <text>Best advice I got: Treat every emission like it's your last. Because it might be.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_4">
    <text>Watched a veteran survive 20 emissions. Died on 21st because he got cocky.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_5">
    <text>Zone gives you 2 minutes warning for a 3-minute killzone. Do the math.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_6">
    <text>Emissions don't discriminate. Rookie or Legend, dead is dead.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_7">
    <text>If you survive 5 emissions, you're lucky. If you survive 10, you're good. If you survive 20, you're paranoid.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_8">
    <text>Never trust the timing. Always assume you have less time than they say.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_9">
    <text>Emissions are the Zone's way of keeping the population down. Don't help it.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_survival_story_mentorship_3_10">
    <text>You'll know you're a veteran when emissions don't scare you. But they should.</text>

    <text>That's double what I made. Who'd you sell to?</text>

<!-- Stage 0: Duty Position (Conviction) -->
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_conviction_0_1">
    <text>The Zone must be contained. Leaving it unchecked is suicide for humanity.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_conviction_0_2">
    <text>Freedom's anarchist bullshit will doom us all. Discipline saves lives.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_conviction_0_3">
    <text>We're the only thing standing between the Zone and civilian populations.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_conviction_0_4">
    <text>Duty exists because someone has to. Freedom exists to get high and shoot at us.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_conviction_0_5">
    <text>Containment isn't oppression. It's survival. Freedom doesn't get that.</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 0: Freedom Position (Conviction) -->
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_rebellion_0_1">
    <text>Contained? You mean oppressed. The Zone is humanity's next evolution.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_rebellion_0_2">
    <text>Duty's fascist checkpoints kill more stalkers than mutants do.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_rebellion_0_3">
    <text>No one owns the Zone. Duty's trying to control what they don't understand.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_rebellion_0_4">
    <text>Free access to the Zone. That's what Freedom fights for. Not Duty's boot.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_rebellion_0_5">
    <text>The Zone's a gift. Duty wants to destroy it. We want to understand it.</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 1: Heated Counter -->
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_anger_1_1">
    <text>Evolution?! Tell that to the families of stalkers killed by your 'evolution'!</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_anger_1_2">
    <text>Fascist?! We're keeping the Zone from consuming cities!</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_anger_1_3">
    <text>Your 'gift' has killed thousands. Some fucking gift.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_anger_1_4">
    <text>Free access? More like free corpses. Your ideology is a death sentence.</text>
</string>
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_anger_1_5">
    <text>Oppression? Try responsibility. Something you'd know nothing about.</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 2: Escalation -->
<string id="st_conv_faction_debate_rage_2_1">
    <text>At least we're not bootlicking authoritarians hiding behind 'duty'.</text>

    <text>Better dead free than alive under your checkpoints.</text>

</string>

    <text>You're no better than the Military. Just with a better PR team.</text>
</string>

<!-- Stage 3: Third Party Cynicism -->

    <text>Both of you shut up. Zone doesn't care about your politics. It kills everyone equally.</text>
</string>

    <text>Duty and Freedom have been arguing for years. Zone's still here. So's the death count.</text>

    <text>You're both idiots. Different flavors, same stupidity.</text>
